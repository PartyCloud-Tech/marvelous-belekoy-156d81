## Slide 1: Title

**Jharkhand Language Bridge**

Hindi / English to Santali communication prototype

**Presented by:** [Your name]
**Date:** [Presentation date]

**Speaker note:** This project explores how simple digital tools can make communication more accessible for Jharkhand's tribal language communities.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

- Many people communicate more naturally in their regional or tribal language.
- Most translation tools focus on widely used languages.
- Santali, Mundari, Ho, and Kurukh need more accessible digital language resources.
- Health, education, government, and everyday communication can be affected by language barriers.

**Speaker note:** The goal is not to replace native speakers. The goal is to support communication and help build useful language resources with the community.

## Slide 3: Our Solution

**Jharkhand Language Bridge** is a mobile-friendly translation prototype that provides:

- Hindi / English input
- Santali output in Ol Chiki script
- Latin transliteration for learners and non-Ol-Chiki readers
- Common phrasebook categories
- Voice input through the browser microphone
- Copy and clear controls
- A foundation for adding more Jharkhand languages

## Slide 4: How the Prototype Works

```text
User types or speaks
          ↓
Input is matched with a reviewed phrase
          ↓
Santali translation is displayed
          ↓
Ol Chiki + Latin transliteration
          ↓
User can copy or review the result
```

**Important:** This first version is an offline phrasebook demonstration. It does not claim to translate every possible sentence yet.

---

## Slide 5: Live Demo

1. Open `index.html` in Chrome or Edge.
2. Click **Thank you** in the phrasebook.
3. Show the Santali result in Ol Chiki: **ᱡᱚᱦᱟᱨ**.
4. Show the Latin transliteration: **Johar**.
5. Type **How are you?** and show the result.
6. Click **Speak**, allow microphone access, and say **Thank you**.
7. Click **Copy result**.
8. Click **Swap languages** to show the reverse direction.

**Backup demo:** If microphone permission is unavailable, use the phrase cards. The complete prototype works without internet or a backend.

## Slide 6: Technology

- HTML for the interface structure
- CSS for responsive design
- JavaScript for phrase matching and interactions
- Browser Web Speech API for voice input
- Offline phrasebook data
- No npm packages, server, or cloud account required

**Why this approach:** It is lightweight, easy to demonstrate, and can run on an ordinary laptop.

## Slide 7: Community-First Development

The next version should be developed with native speakers and language experts:

- Collect Hindi / English / tribal-language sentence pairs.
- Review translations with at least two fluent speakers.
- Record pronunciation from native speakers.
- Keep dialects and regional variations separate.
- Add correction and feedback tools.
- Protect community ownership and obtain permission for all language data.

---

## Slide 8: Roadmap

**Phase 1: Prototype**
- Santali phrasebook
- Ol Chiki and transliteration
- Voice input

**Phase 2: Larger language dataset**
- Thousands of reviewed sentences
- Health, education, agriculture, and government vocabulary
- Native-speaker review workflow

**Phase 3: Intelligent translation**
- Hindi ↔ Santali translation model
- English support
- Confidence scores and human review

**Phase 4: Expand access**
- Mundari, Ho, Kurukh, and Kharia
- Android application
- Offline language packs

---

## Slide 9: Expected Impact

- Better access to important information
- Support for tribal-language learning
- More digital visibility for Jharkhand languages
- Useful communication support for schools, health workers, and local services
- A reusable platform for community-owned language technology

## Slide 10: Closing

**Language technology works best when technology listens to the community.**

This prototype is the first step toward inclusive, community-reviewed translation for Jharkhand.

**Thank you**

# Short answers for questions

**Is this a complete AI translator?**

No. This is a working phrasebook prototype. A full translator requires a larger native-speaker-reviewed dataset and a trained translation model.

**Why start with Santali?**

Santali has an established Ol Chiki script and is a strong starting point for testing the workflow before expanding to other languages.

**Does voice translation work?**

English voice input works in supported Chrome or Edge browsers after microphone permission is granted. The recognized phrase is matched against the current demo phrasebook.

**Can this translate any sentence?**

Not yet. The current offline prototype supports the included demo phrases. Any-sentence translation is part of the next development phase.

**What is the most important next step?**

Build a larger, carefully reviewed parallel dataset with native speakers and language experts.
